This blog is a repository for my notes on implementing computer vision features on iOS using Metal (including MetalKit and MetalPerformanceShaders frameworks). 

Every single note serves as a complete example to a specific feature. If you find those notesÂ may help as tutorials, please enjoy! But don't forgive me for any awkward writing (in both code and English), tell me in comments. Thanks!
